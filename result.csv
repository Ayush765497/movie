I think everyone played their parts well, though Eddie Murphy is showing his age trying to play a street punk and more of a role he would have mastered 25 years ago. I was never bored with the movie, but it just wasnt that good. Its a popcorn flick. Rent it when you are bored, don't expect too much from it, and you wont be disappointed.", Average Movie

If you compare this DISCOVERY channel version with the excellent BBC version, you will notice that most all the science and particularly mentions of evolution have been removed.

His voice  more like a thug then the quintessential cracky voice that I am so used to.The storyline was fantastic I thought it flowed flawlessly and a few parts kept me on the edge of my seat. but alas I have grown up with one voice of the Joker and he doesn't sound like a deep voiced thug. (I believe this was more about popularity of the actor and not staying within the same ideal of the the original joker.), Great anime but the joker voice killed me.

Even though the film technically isn't in 3-D anymore, the gags used to make the 3-D effect are hilarious. The humor alone makes this film worth seeing.

I highly recommend Legend, it has all the extras you could want and the 2nd dvd is a darker directors cut.", This is one of the great classics to me

If you liked Shaun of the Dead you are going to love this movie because it is more of the same but twice as good. The jokes are a breath of fresh air compared to what traditional ""Hollywood"" thinks is funny these days and the two main actors have the same kind of repor that you are already used to from their previous movie.<br /><br />Bottomline is this is a great action comedy. The main character is believable, and his sidekick is very lovable. Another great flick for fans of HD DVD!", Better than Shaun of the Dead!

So, before you cut the cellophane, grab a couple extra boxes, in case your set was cheaply produced anyway.  But, on the plus side, the discs I have viewed are all excellent for clarity and content.

El Mariachi is the prequel to Desperado which starred somebody who clearly is not Antonio Banderas. Mariachi had horrible acting but it did kind of set the stage for Desperado. For some reason the movie is all in Spanish. It was just made that way. Desperado was a classic and I loved it. Salma Hayek is so sexy in the movie especially when she is sing her solo song while Antonio is recovering from a lo g night of love making to her. Not bad for getting a double feature for $15, Double Feature

The plot line is predictable but is presented in a way that makes it entertaining. There are some scenes that are not believable and could have been better. The most glaring are the robbery scenes.

There are few difficult scenes that will make you wince but overall it is workable. The chase scenes are generally good but the opening scenes is painful to watch. It just does not appear plausible and does not make much sense.  Overall, not bad", Point Break meets racers.

The drama in my opinion seems so realistic and believable, I love the way that they tie history into the show, (i.e. Monroe's suicide, JFK presidency/assassination, cold war...)

This script really pushes Anne's heartbreak to the forefront but that's appropriate and really what makes the story so relevant.

It was a story of a mother and daughter gaining a better understanding of each other.  That was so touching.  It was a story of friends and how they are not always in the same place emotionally and that the friendship can survive the hurts with understanding.  It was a tear jerker --- but it was thought provoking too.  I will watch it again., Love It

What you'll find are a series of tense situations throughout Europe where the Israeli protagonists plant bombs to kill associates of the terrorists responsible for the Munich killings. I watched, engrossed, during their first mission, but after that things started to get old. The violent, stressful, predictable scenes started to tire me out after the third mission to kill yet another terrorist associate. Munich is a good film, but it's too long. I would have been far more satisfied if the movie was an hour shorter.", Too long and tiring

I have an XBox360 with HD-DVD add-on, attached to an Onkyo HD receiver and a Samsung 56"" DLP HDTV, and these DVD's worked wonderfully on my gear.  Similar to others, I was disappointed that the first two DVD's were in different packaging, but I mostly care about the actual videos and we enjoyed watching them very much.  Now, if I could only hope to get the final two on HD-DVD ... ah well, I guess I will catch them via Blockbuster download or something like that ... cheers to all!", Great fun ...,"['Reservoir Dogs 15th Anniversary 2 Disc Set in Ltd Edition Gas Can', 'Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre', 'Why We Fight', 'Three Kings', 'The Evil Dead', 'The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season', 'The Last House on the Left', 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines', 'The Guardian', 'The Family Stone', 'Groundhog Day', 'American Werewolf in London', 'Forbidden Planet', 'Rio', 'There Will Be Blood', 'LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory', 'Jurassic Park', 'Friday the 13th, Part 3', 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture', 'The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns', 'The Human Centipede', 'Cloverfield', 'Escape From the Planet of the Apes', 'City of God', 'The Lives Of Others', 'Resident Evil DVD', 'The Best of Schoolhouse Rock! - 30th Anniversary Edition', 'Aliens: Special Edition', 'Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory', 'Closer', 'Alien Quadrilogy', 'From Dusk Till Dawn', 'Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief', 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', 'The Breakfast Club - Summer Comedy Movie Cash', 'Casino', 'Evil Dead', 'Beetle Juice', 'National Treasure 2: Book Of Secrets', 'Good Will Hunting', 'Bad Boys 2', 'Seven Samurai', 'The Iron Giant', 'The Simpsons Movie', 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', 'Star Trek - The Motion Picture', 'Evil Dead 2', 'The Girl Who Played With Fire', 'Identidad Desconocida', 'My Week With Marilyn', 'Dodgeball:  A True Underdog Story Unrated', 'Veronica Mars: Season 1', 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon', 'Apocalypto', 'Kill Bill: Volume 2', 'Hannibal', 'Alice in Wonderland', 'The Velveteen Rabbit', 'Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed', 'The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill', 'Primer', 'I Love Lucy: The Complete Series', 'Legally Blonde Blu-ray', 'Puss in Boots', 'Invasion - The Complete Series', 'Maltese Falcon / Movie', 'Rear Window', 'Night Of The Living Dead', 'The Silence of the Lambs', 'Battlestar Galactica', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'Catwoman', 'Angels & Demons', 'Spanglish', 'Psycho', 'Battle Los Angeles', 'Something The Lord Made', 'Jumper', 'Practical Magic', 'Rome: The Complete Series', 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer  - The Complete Sixth Season', 'Psycho: Universal Legacy Series', 'Underworld: Evolution', 'Dog Soldiers', 'Superman The Movie', 'Lady and the Tramp', 'Zombie', 'Red Cliff International Version - Part I & Part II', 'Tucker & Dale vs Evil', 'Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back', 'Arrested Development: Season 2', 'The Time Machine', 'New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', 'Religulous', 'Young Frankenstein - Special Edition', 'Run Lola Run', 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan', 'Chicago and Earth, Wind &  Fire: Live at the Greek Theatre', 'Bajo el Sol de Toscana', 'What Dreams May Come', 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', 'Billy Elliot', 'Joe Bonamassa Live from the Royal Albert Hall', 'Airplane', 'Léon the Professional', 'The Princess and The Frog', 'E.T. - The Extraterrestrial', '40 Year Old Virgin', 'The Sopranos: Season 1', 'Tin Man', 'Unforgiven', 'Amazing Grace', 'Gilmore Girls: Season 6', 'Lost Boys', 'Signing Time!

His charactor is deep and he portrays a kind of Villain good guy role you never know which until the end.  The scenery is awesome and the fight scenes excellent except the river scene in which the gun shots sound strange but overall an exclellent movie that keeps you guessing with deep plots and excellent charactors.

I knew when the music came that someone was gonna DIE ! I also liked the satanic hellhound dog and the crow from the trilogy. The new movie is not as thrilling. The visual quality is excellent. Some of the actors seem bored themselves in this movie. It seems like like they wanted this movie to be overwith and take home their paycheck asap. It might just be me but thats what i noticed. Julia Stiles and Mia Farrow did an excellent job though. I dont think a 5 year old would enjoy this more than 1 time., Not as good as the Original but still not bad.

Starship Troopers is likely to attract disdain from  both conservatives (for its social attitude) and liberals (for its  political attitude).

If they lose not only do they get beheaded but their families will die in the worst way. The bad warlord has an army over 800,000...the other has 100,000; all characters are connected as the movie reveals throughout. Watch this film, war strategy, gore, and on top of it all beautiful scenes throughout. The storyline is great too.", RC I-II will leave you in Awe.

Julia Stiles and Mia Farrow did an excellent job though. I dont think a 5 year old would enjoy this more than 1 time., Not as good as the Original but still not bad.

Either way, both versions are good to have because the new one has some never before scenes not originally release in the 1982 version.  So that was fun to look at.", Great 2 Disc Collector's Edition!

We tell everyone how we spent the entire weekend glued to the TV., Addictive

He uses his humour, and puppets, to show the absurdity of people having such stereotypical beliefs. Besides to anyone who tries to say anything bad about this DVD all I can say is ""Silence!....
